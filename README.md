This projects aims to gather valuable insights from the Adidas US sales dataset to drive decision-making processes
## KEY INSIGHTS
* West Gear is the best performing retailer with  $242,964,333.00 in sales and $85,667,873.18 in profit
* Walmart does not make lot of sales compared to other retailers(maybe because walmart might not be the place people first think of when they want to get footwear or apparel)
* There are more sales in store than online which may suggest people may prefer to buy footwear and apparel in physical shops rather than online
